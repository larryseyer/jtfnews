#### YouTube Description:

Just The Facts News - Live 

Facts only. No opinions. 

Think of us as a very slow, very honest librarian. We read everything, say nothing unless two other librarians agree, and never raise our voice. 24/7 automated news. 

Verified facts only. 

"If we stay boring enough, we might just change the world."

## Tag Strategy Notes

1. **Primary differentiator**: Emphasize what JTF News *doesn't* do (no opinions, no drama, no sensationalism) - this is the unique selling point

2. **Calm aesthetic**: Tags like "ambient news," "relaxing news," and "ASMR news" may attract viewers seeking news without anxiety

3. **Trust signals**: Verification-related tags appeal to those skeptical of mainstream media

4. **Rotate periodically**: YouTube's algorithm may respond to tag freshness - consider rotating secondary tags monthly

5. **Avoid**: Don't use "breaking news" (contradicts our philosophy), political party names, or controversial terms
