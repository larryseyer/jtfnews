## Main Post

Two sources. Different owners. Strip the adjectives. State the facts. Stop.

JTF News is 24/7 automated reporting of verified facts. No opinions. No adjectives. No interpretation.

This is not journalism. It is data.

The methodology belongs to no one. It serves everyone.

Links in the comments.
