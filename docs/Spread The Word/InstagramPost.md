## Caption (2,200 character limit)

Two sources. Different owners. Strip the adjectives. State the facts. Stop.

JTF News is 24/7 automated reporting of verified facts.

No opinions. No adjectives. No interpretation.

This is not journalism. It is data.

THE METHODOLOGY:
• Two unrelated sources minimum
• AI strips all editorialization
• Official titles only
• No engagement—we report once, never reply

The methodology belongs to no one. It serves everyone.
