# JTF News: 501(c)(3) Structure with Commercial Licensing

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the recommended legal structure for JTF News: a **501(c)(3) non-profit organization** that creates and distributes fact-based news content for public benefit, with the ability to license that content to commercial entities at fair market value.

## Why This Structure Works

### 1. Clear Public Benefit (IRS Requirement)

The 501(c)(3) designation requires that the organization operate **exclusively for exempt purposes**. JTF News qualifies under the **educational** category because it:

- Provides factual information to the public
- Operates a free, publicly accessible news service
- Releases content under open license (CC-BY-SA)
- Does not charge the public for access

**The commercial licensing is incidental to the primary mission, not the purpose of the organization.**

### 2. No Private Inurement

The IRS prohibits any part of a 501(c)(3)'s net earnings from benefiting private individuals. This structure ensures compliance:

- All licensing is offered at **fair market value** to **any qualified buyer**
- No sweetheart deals for founders or insiders
- Licensing revenue goes to the non-profit, not individuals
- Board members with conflicts recuse from related decisions

### 3. No Substantial Private Benefit

While some private benefit to commercial licensees is acceptable (they receive valuable content), it must be:

- **Incidental** to the public benefit
- **Qualitatively and quantitatively insubstantial** compared to public benefit

This structure satisfies these requirements because:

- The primary output (free public stream) serves millions
- Commercial licensing serves a much smaller audience
- Commercial customers could be anyone—no special access for insiders

## Licensing Model Details

### Open Public License (CC-BY-SA)

All JTF News content is released under **Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike (CC-BY-SA)**:

- Anyone can use the content for free
- Attribution required
- Derivative works must use same license
- Commercial use permitted under these terms

### Commercial License (Fee-Based)

For commercial entities that want:

- No attribution requirement
- Custom formats or delivery
- Service level agreements
- Technical support
- Exclusive access to premium features

**These licenses are offered at fair market value, determined by:**

1. Comparable market rates for similar content licensing
2. Independent third-party valuation (recommended)
3. Board-approved rate schedule
4. Documentation of methodology

### Sample Licensing Fee Structure

| License Tier | Use Case | Annual Fee Range* |
|--------------|----------|-------------------|
| Small Business | Single location display | $500 - $2,000 |
| Enterprise | Multiple locations | $5,000 - $25,000 |
| Custom Integration | API access, custom delivery | Negotiated |

*Fees should be validated against market comparables and reviewed annually.

---

## Governance Requirements

### Board of Directors

To ensure IRS compliance and avoid conflicts of interest:

**Composition:**
- Minimum 3 board members (IRS best practice)
- Majority should be **independent** (no financial interest in commercial activities)
- Include at least one member with non-profit governance experience

**Conflict of Interest Policy (Required):**
- Written policy adopted by the board
- Annual disclosure statements from all board members
- Recusal from any vote where a conflict exists
- Documentation of all conflict disclosures and recusals

### Founder Considerations

If a JTF News founder also operates or has financial interest in a company that licenses JTF content:

1. **Full disclosure** to the board in writing
2. **Recusal** from any board votes related to that license
3. **Fair market value** licensing—same terms as any other customer
4. **Documentation** that terms were reviewed by independent board members
5. **Annual review** of the arrangement

**This is not prohibited—it just requires transparency and proper process.**

---

## Tax Considerations

### Donations

- Donations to JTF News Foundation are **tax-deductible** for donors
- This is a significant fundraising advantage

### Unrelated Business Income Tax (UBIT)

Commercial licensing fees may be subject to UBIT. However:

**Potentially Exempt as Royalties:**
- Passive licensing of intellectual property
- No significant services provided beyond the content itself
- Structured as royalty payments for use of copyrighted material

**Potentially Subject to UBIT:**
- Licensing bundled with significant services
- Custom content creation for licensees
- Active management of licensee relationships

**Recommendation:** Structure standard licenses as passive royalties. Consult a tax attorney for specific guidance.

### Filing Requirements

- **Form 990** annual return (public document)
- **Form 990-T** if UBIT applies
- State registration requirements vary

---

## Operational Safeguards

### Documentation Requirements

Maintain records demonstrating:

1. **Public benefit primacy**
   - Usage statistics for free public stream
   - Evidence of public engagement and impact
   - Comparison of public vs. commercial reach

2. **Fair market value licensing**
   - Market research supporting fee structure
   - Board minutes approving rate schedules
   - Written agreements with all licensees

3. **Conflict management**
   - Conflict of interest policy
   - Annual disclosure forms
   - Board minutes showing recusals

### Annual Compliance Checklist

- [ ] Board reviews and approves licensing fee structure
- [ ] Conflict of interest disclosures collected from all board members
- [ ] Form 990 filed (public disclosure)
- [ ] State registration renewals completed
- [ ] Insurance coverage reviewed
- [ ] Licensing agreements reviewed for compliance

## What NOT to Do

To maintain 501(c)(3) status and avoid IRS issues:

### Prohibited Actions

| Action | Why It's Prohibited |
|--------|---------------------|
| Give below-market licenses to founder's company | Private inurement |
| Create content primarily for commercial licensees | Private benefit |
| Pay excessive compensation to founders | Private inurement |
| Allow board members to personally profit from decisions | Self-dealing |
| Engage in political campaign activity | Absolute prohibition for 501(c)(3) |
| Substantial lobbying without 501(h) election | May jeopardize status |

### Red Flags That Attract IRS Scrutiny

- Related-party transactions without documentation
- License fees significantly below market rate
- Board dominated by individuals with financial interests
- Commercial revenue far exceeding public benefit activities
- Lack of written policies and procedures

## Comparison: Why Not Other Structures?

| Structure | Pros | Cons | Recommendation |
|-----------|------|------|----------------|
| **501(c)(3) with licensing** | Tax-deductible donations, clear public benefit, proven model | Some complexity, UBIT possible | **RECOMMENDED** |
| Separate 501(c)(3) + For-Profit LLC | Maximum separation | Higher complexity, potential IRS scrutiny of relationship | Not recommended unless needed |
| L3C (Low-Profit LLC) | Hybrid structure | Not recognized in all states, limited track record | Not recommended |
| B-Corp | Social mission built in | Not tax-exempt, no deductible donations | Not recommended |
| For-Profit only | Simplest | No tax benefits, harder to fundraise | Not recommended |

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can a founder also run a company that licenses from JTF News?

**Yes**, with proper safeguards:
- Full disclosure to the board
- Recusal from related votes
- Fair market value terms (same as any customer)
- Documentation of independent board approval

### Does licensing income jeopardize 501(c)(3) status?

**No**, if properly structured:
- Primary activities serve public benefit
- Licensing is incidental, not the main purpose
- Fees are at fair market value
- Proper documentation maintained

### What if commercial licensing becomes very successful?

Success is fine, but maintain balance:
- Continue prioritizing free public access
- Ensure commercial revenue doesn't become primary purpose
- Document that public benefit remains primary
- Consider whether structure adjustments are needed

### Do we need a separate for-profit entity?

**Not necessarily.** The simplest approach:
- Non-profit licenses directly to commercial customers
- No separate entity needed
- Customers can be anyone, including founder-related companies
- Proper documentation and fair dealing required

A separate for-profit might make sense later if:
- Commercial activities become very large
- You want to raise investment capital
- You need to pay significantly above-market compensation

## Conclusion

The recommended structure—a 501(c)(3) non-profit that creates free public news content and licenses that content commercially at fair market rates—is:

- **Legal and IRS-compliant** when properly implemented
- **Well-established** with many successful precedents
- **Aligned with JTF News mission** of providing fact-based news

The key principles are simple:

4. **Independent oversight** — board members without conflicts make key decisions

This structure allows JTF News to pursue its mission of providing fact-based news to the public while building sustainable revenue through commercial licensing—all within full compliance of IRS regulations.
