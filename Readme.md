## What is JTF News?

A 24/7 automated news stream that reports only verified facts. Every fact is confirmed by **2+ independent sources** before broadcast.

- No opinions
- No adjectives

Just facts.

## The Philosophy

> "If we stay boring enough, we might just change the world."

JTF News exists because modern news often tells you how to feel about events rather than simply reporting what happened.

## Source Verification

Sources are rated 0-10 based on verification track record:
- How often their facts are confirmed by other outlets
- Asterisk (*) indicates limited data (cold start)

Sources must be **unrelated** - different owners, different investors.

## Technology

- Python automation with resilience system
- Claude AI (Haiku) for fact extraction
- ElevenLabs TTS for voice synthesis
- OBS for streaming
- GitHub Pages for web assets

## Support

JTF News is viewer-supported. No ads. No tracking.
