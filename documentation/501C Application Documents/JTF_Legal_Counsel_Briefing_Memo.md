*Status: DRAFT — For Counsel Review and Discussion*

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Just the Facts News (JTF News) seeks recognition as a tax-exempt organization under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. The organization's mission is to develop and distribute a structured, transparent methodology for factual reporting without commentary, opinion, or advocacy, and to make that methodology freely available for public education and community replication.

This memo summarizes the organizational status, the governance and policy framework prepared to date, the key legal issues counsel should evaluate, and the outstanding action items required before filing.

## 2. Organizational Status

JTF News has not yet commenced operations. The organization is in the pre-filing stage. The following items require confirmation or completion before counsel prepares the Form 1023 submission.

**Formation documents.** Articles of incorporation must be filed (or confirmed as filed) in the state of organization. The articles must include the required IRS purpose and dissolution language under Section 501(c)(3) and the applicable Treasury Regulations. Counsel should confirm that the articles contain an explicit statement of exclusively charitable and educational purposes, a prohibition on private inurement, a prohibition on political campaign activity, a limitation on lobbying consistent with Section 501(c)(3), and a dissolution clause directing remaining assets to another 501(c)(3) organization or governmental entity.

**Bylaws.** Bylaws should be adopted by the Board and should be consistent with the governance structure described in the attached Board Governance Structure document. Counsel should review or draft bylaws addressing board composition, terms, quorum and voting requirements, officer roles, committee authorities, indemnification provisions, and amendment procedures.

**Employer Identification Number.** An EIN must be obtained prior to filing. If not yet obtained, this should be done promptly.

## 3. Governance and Policy Framework

The following governance documents have been prepared in draft and are attached for counsel review. Each is designed to satisfy IRS expectations for a well-governed 501(c)(3) applicant and to address the specific operational characteristics of JTF News.

**Board Governance Structure.** This document defines the organizational hierarchy, the role of the Board of Directors, the Executive Director, and three standing committees (Audit & Compliance, Governance & Ethics, and Development). Counsel should evaluate whether the committee structure and delegated authorities are consistent with state nonprofit corporation law and whether any provisions should be reflected in the bylaws rather than a standalone policy.

**Conflict of Interest Policy.** This policy requires annual written disclosures by all directors and officers, recusal from conflicted decisions, and board review and documentation of conflicts. It is drafted to meet the requirements of IRS Form 1023 Schedule B and the governance standards described in IRS Publication 4221-PC. Counsel should confirm that the policy satisfies the disclosure, recusal, and documentation standards expected by the IRS.

**Editorial Firewall Policy.** This policy mandates structural separation between fundraising, operational, and editorial methodology functions. It provides that no donor, sponsor, board member, or staff member may override verification thresholds or publication rules. This policy is central to the organization's exempt purpose claim, as it demonstrates that editorial methodology serves an educational function rather than a commercial or private interest.

**Donor Non-Interference Policy.** This policy prohibits donors from influencing editorial methodology, verification standards, content selection, or publication timing. It requires disclosure of major donors in annual transparency reports. Counsel should evaluate whether the disclosure provisions comply with applicable state charitable solicitation laws and whether additional provisions are advisable regarding donor-advised fund contributions or conditional grants.

**Whistleblower Policy.** This policy establishes reporting channels, investigation procedures, anti-retaliation protections, and documentation requirements. It is drafted to satisfy the IRS governance question on Form 1023 regarding whistleblower protections and to meet the standards recommended in IRS Governance and Related Topics guidance.

**Document Retention and Destruction Policy.** This policy establishes retention schedules for corporate, tax, financial, employment, donor, and editorial records, along with destruction procedures and litigation hold provisions. It is drafted to satisfy the IRS governance question on Form 1023 regarding document retention.

## 4. Key Legal Issues for Counsel Evaluation

### 4.1 Exempt Purpose Classification

The primary legal question is whether JTF News's activities qualify as charitable and educational under Section 501(c)(3). The organization's position is that its activities satisfy the educational purpose test under Treasury Regulation Section 1.501(c)(3)-1(d)(3) because they provide instruction to the public on subjects useful to the individual and beneficial to the community, specifically factual reporting methodology and transparent information sourcing.

Counsel should evaluate the strength of the educational purpose argument and whether the organization's activities could be characterized as commercial publishing rather than educational activity. The key distinctions to articulate are the absence of advertising revenue, the open licensing of methodology, the community replication program, and the structural separation of editorial methodology from financial influences.

Counsel should also consider whether the organization could alternatively or additionally qualify under the charitable purpose test as promoting social welfare through informed civic awareness.

### 4.2 Political Activity Risk

JTF News will report on government actions as factual events. Although the organization's methodology is designed to remove evaluative language, counsel should evaluate whether IRS examiners may view reporting on elected officials or legislative actions as presenting political activity risk. The organization's position is that factual reporting without commentary does not constitute intervention in a political campaign. Counsel should advise on whether additional safeguards or policy language would strengthen this position.

### 4.3 Private Benefit and Inurement

Counsel should review the compensation arrangements planned for officers and key employees and confirm that a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness process will be followed under Treasury Regulation Section 53.4958-6. Counsel should also evaluate whether the early-access technical membership program creates any private benefit concerns and whether the membership benefits are insubstantial relative to the contribution amount.

### 4.4 State Law Compliance

Counsel should identify any state-specific requirements for nonprofit formation, charitable solicitation registration, and ongoing compliance in the state of organization and in any states where the organization will actively solicit donations.

### 4.5 Intellectual Property and Licensing

The organization plans to use Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike (CC-BY-SA) licensing for its methodology documentation. Counsel should confirm that this licensing approach is consistent with the organization's exempt purpose and does not create unintended obligations or risks.
