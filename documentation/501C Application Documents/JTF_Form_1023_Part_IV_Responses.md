## Part IV — Narrative Description of Your Activities

### Line 1: Describe completely and in detail your past, present, and planned activities.

**Response:**

Just the Facts News (JTF News) is a newly formed organization that has not yet commenced operations. Upon recognition of exempt status, JTF News will develop and distribute a structured, transparent methodology for factual reporting without commentary, opinion, or advocacy. Its purpose is to provide the general public with accessible summaries of verifiable recent events using defined verification and sourcing standards.

**Present and Planned Activities:**

**Activity 1 — Structured Factual Reporting.** JTF News will operate a continuously updated global news stream delivered through a publicly accessible website and data feeds. Each published item will meet predefined inclusion thresholds for public significance, be corroborated by at least two unrelated qualifying sources, be processed through rule-based language transformation to remove evaluative or speculative language, and include source ownership transparency where publicly available. No opinion, commentary, endorsements, or calls to action will be published. This activity will constitute approximately 60% of organizational effort and resources.

**Activity 2 — Methodology Publication and Education.** JTF News will publish open documentation of its verification standards, ownership disclosure methodology, correction logs, and version-controlled methodology updates. All materials will be publicly accessible to serve an educational purpose, enabling researchers, students, and civic organizations to study and evaluate factual reporting methodology. This activity will constitute approximately 20% of organizational effort and resources.

**Activity 3 — Community Replication Program.** JTF News will provide open licensing under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike (CC-BY-SA) for communities to adopt the methodology for local informational channels, including civic reporting, school board meeting summaries, and sports results. Technical documentation and guidance materials will be made available at no cost. This activity will constitute approximately 20% of organizational effort and resources.

### Line 1(a): Who will conduct each activity?

**Response:**

Activity 1 will be conducted by the Executive Director and paid editorial staff, with oversight from the Board of Directors through the Audit & Compliance Committee. Technology implementation will be managed by in-house or contracted technical staff under the direction of the Executive Director.

Activity 2 will be conducted by the Executive Director and editorial staff, with version-controlled methodology documents reviewed and acknowledged by the Board of Directors through the Governance & Ethics Committee.

Activity 3 will be managed by the Executive Director and program staff. Community partners will operate independently under the CC-BY-SA license. JTF News staff will provide documentation and technical guidance but will not exercise editorial control over community implementations.

---

### Line 1(b): When will each activity be initiated?

**Response:**

Activity 1 is planned to launch within six months of receiving IRS determination, beginning with a limited-scope pilot covering a defined set of news categories before expanding to full global coverage.

Activity 2 will commence concurrently with Activity 1, as the methodology documentation must be published prior to or simultaneously with the first published news items.

Activity 3 will commence within twelve months of receiving IRS determination, after the core methodology has been validated through Activity 1 operations.

---

### Line 1(c): Where will each activity be conducted?

**Response:**

All activities will be conducted primarily through internet-based platforms accessible to the general public worldwide. The organization's principal office will be located in [STATE — TO BE CONFIRMED]. Staff may work remotely. No physical public-facing facilities are planned at this time.

---

### Line 1(d): How will each activity further your exempt purpose?

**Response:**

Activity 1 directly advances the organization's educational and charitable purposes by providing the public with structured, verified factual information free from opinion, advocacy, or persuasion. This increases informed civic awareness and provides an educational resource demonstrating how factual information can be presented transparently.

Activity 2 furthers the educational purpose by making the organization's methodology openly available for public scrutiny, academic study, and replication. This transparency serves an educational function analogous to publishing research methodology in academic contexts.

Activity 3 extends the charitable and educational benefit by enabling under-resourced communities to adopt proven factual reporting methods for local civic information needs, reducing information asymmetry at the community level.

---

### Line 2: What are or will be your sources of financial support?

**Response:**

Revenue will be derived from individual donations, foundation grants, and optional early-access technical memberships that provide supporters with early access to methodology documentation and technical tools. No advertising revenue will be accepted. All revenue sources are subject to the organization's Donor Non-Interference Policy, which prohibits any financial contributor from influencing editorial methodology, verification standards, inclusion thresholds, or publication timing. Major donors will be disclosed in annual transparency reports in accordance with applicable law.

---

### Line 3: Describe your organization's fundraising program.

**Response:**

JTF News will solicit support through its website, direct outreach to foundations aligned with media transparency and civic education, and periodic fundraising communications to supporters. The organization does not plan to engage professional fundraisers or conduct special fundraising events at this time. A Development Committee of the Board of Directors will oversee fundraising strategy and donor compliance monitoring. All fundraising activities will be conducted in compliance with applicable state charitable solicitation registration requirements.

## Additional Part IV Considerations for Counsel Review

### Operational Test Compliance

The responses above are drafted to demonstrate that JTF News satisfies the operational test under Treas. Reg. § 1.501(c)(3)-1(c) by showing that the organization will be operated exclusively for exempt purposes and that no part of its net earnings will inure to the benefit of any private individual.

### Political Activity Prohibition — Part IV Supplement

JTF News does not and will not participate in or intervene in any political campaign on behalf of or in opposition to any candidate for public office. The organization will not endorse or oppose candidates, rate political actors, or engage in lobbying or legislative advocacy. Government actions may be reported as structured factual events using the organization's standard methodology, without evaluative language, commentary, or advocacy framing.

### Private Benefit / Private Inurement

No officer, director, or key employee will receive unreasonable compensation. Compensation levels will be set by the Board of Directors using comparability data from similarly situated organizations. The Conflict of Interest Policy requires annual written disclosures and recusal from conflicted decisions.
