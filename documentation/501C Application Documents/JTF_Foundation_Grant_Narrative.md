------------------------------------------------------------------------

## I. Organizational Overview

Just the Facts News (JTF News) is a nonprofit initiative developing a
transparent, algorithmic framework for structured factual reporting
without commentary or narrative framing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## II. Problem Statement

Public trust in media institutions has declined as reporting
increasingly blends verified events with interpretation and analysis.
Audiences seeking verifiable records must navigate narrative framing and
opinion-driven presentation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## III. Proposed Solution

JTF News establishes a structured reporting layer that: - Applies
defined inclusion thresholds - Requires corroboration from unrelated
sources - Uses rule-based AI transformation to remove evaluative
language - Publishes ownership transparency for cited sources -
Maintains a public corrections log

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## IV. Methodological Integrity

All processes are publicly documented. Verification requires two
unrelated sources. Ownership structures are disclosed where available.
Conflicts of interest are formally prohibited in governance documents.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## V. Public Benefit

The organization provides: - Accessible factual summaries - Open
licensing for reuse - Transparency in sourcing - A replicable framework
adaptable to local communities

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## VI. Sustainability & Governance

Revenue sources: - Individual donations - Foundation grants - Optional
early-access technical memberships

The organization distributes no profits and maintains independent board
oversight.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## VII. Evaluation & Metrics

Impact will be measured through: - Publication consistency - Correction
transparency rates - Adoption of methodology by community channels -
Public reuse under open license

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## VIII. Compliance

JTF News does not endorse candidates, advocate for legislation, or
engage in lobbying activities. Activities are structured to comply fully
with IRS 501(c)(3) standards for educational and informational
organizations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Conclusion

JTF News seeks to strengthen civic infrastructure by providing a neutral
factual reference layer beneath public discourse.
