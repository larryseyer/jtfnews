## 1. Purpose

This policy establishes procedures for the reporting, investigation, and resolution of complaints regarding potential violations of law, regulation, organizational policy, or fiduciary duty by directors, officers, employees, or contractors of Just the Facts News (JTF News). This policy is adopted to comply with the governance best practices recommended by the Internal Revenue Service for Section 501(c)(3) organizations and to satisfy the requirements referenced in IRS Form 1023 Schedule E.

---

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all directors, officers, employees, contractors, and volunteers of JTF News. It covers reports concerning suspected fraud, financial irregularities, violations of federal or state law, violations of the organization's conflict of interest policy, violations of the editorial firewall or donor non-interference policies, misuse of organizational assets, retaliation against any person who has made a good-faith report, and any conduct that threatens the integrity of the organization's exempt purpose.

## 3. Reporting Procedures

### 3.1 How to Report

Any person covered by this policy who has a reasonable belief that a violation has occurred or is occurring should report the concern using one or more of the following channels: direct written or verbal report to the Chair of the Governance & Ethics Committee, direct written report to the Chair of the Board of Directors (if the concern involves a member of the Governance & Ethics Committee), or submission through a designated confidential reporting mechanism established by the Board.

### 3.2 Content of Reports

Reports should include, to the extent known, the nature of the suspected violation, the individuals involved, the approximate date or dates of the conduct, any evidence or documentation supporting the concern, and whether the reporting individual wishes to remain anonymous.

### 3.3 Anonymous Reports

Anonymous reports will be accepted and investigated to the extent feasible. However, the organization encourages identified reporting where possible, as anonymity may limit the ability to investigate effectively or to provide follow-up to the reporting individual.

## 4. Investigation Procedures

### 4.1 Acknowledgment

The receiving officer shall acknowledge receipt of the report within five business days, unless the report was submitted anonymously.

### 4.2 Initial Review

The Governance & Ethics Committee (or the Board Chair, where applicable) shall conduct an initial review to determine whether the report, if true, would constitute a violation within the scope of this policy. This determination shall be made within fifteen business days of receipt.

### 4.3 Investigation

If the initial review finds the report within scope, the Committee shall authorize a formal investigation. The investigation may be conducted by Committee members, by the Executive Director (provided the Executive Director is not a subject of the complaint), or by outside legal counsel or an independent investigator retained for the purpose. The investigation shall be conducted with appropriate confidentiality, giving due regard to the rights of the reporting individual and the subject of the report.

### 4.4 Findings and Resolution

Upon completion of the investigation, the Committee shall prepare a written summary of findings and recommended actions. The summary shall be presented to the Board of Directors. The Board shall determine appropriate corrective action, which may include policy changes, personnel actions up to and including termination, referral to law enforcement, or other remedial measures.

### 4.5 Record Retention

All reports, investigation records, and findings shall be retained in accordance with the organization's Document Retention and Destruction Policy and for no less than seven years from the date of resolution.

## 5. Protection Against Retaliation

### 5.1 Prohibition

No director, officer, employee, or contractor of JTF News shall retaliate against any individual who makes a good-faith report under this policy, participates in an investigation, or refuses to participate in conduct the individual reasonably believes to be unlawful. Retaliation includes but is not limited to termination, demotion, suspension, harassment, threats, or any adverse action taken because of a protected report.

### 5.2 Consequences of Retaliation

Any person found to have retaliated against a reporting individual shall be subject to disciplinary action up to and including removal from their position, as determined by the Board of Directors.

### 5.3 Good Faith Requirement

This policy protects reports made in good faith. A report is made in good faith when the reporting individual has a reasonable belief that the information provided is true at the time of the report. Reports that are knowingly false or made with malicious intent are not protected and may result in disciplinary action against the reporting individual.

---

## 6. Confidentiality

JTF News shall treat all reports with appropriate confidentiality, disclosing information only to those who have a legitimate need to know in order to conduct an investigation or implement corrective action, or as required by law.

---

## 7. Board Oversight

The Governance & Ethics Committee shall provide an annual summary to the Board of Directors reporting the number of complaints received, the general nature of complaints, the disposition of investigations, and any systemic issues identified. This summary shall not disclose the identity of reporting individuals without their consent.

## 8. Distribution and Acknowledgment

This policy shall be distributed to all directors, officers, employees, and contractors of JTF News. Each individual shall sign a written acknowledgment of receipt. New directors, officers, employees, and contractors shall receive this policy and sign the acknowledgment as part of their onboarding process.
