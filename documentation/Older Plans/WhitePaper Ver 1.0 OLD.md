# Just the Facts News
## Algorithmic Reporting for a Narrative-Free World

*"If we stay boring enough, we might just change the world."*

### 0. What is News?
A verifiable event, within the last twenty-four hours, that meets at least one of these criteria:
- Affects five hundred people or more
- Costs or invests at least one million US dollars
- Changes a law or regulation
- Redraws a border
- Involves death or violent crime
- Major scientific or technological achievement
- Humanitarian milestone
- Official statement or action by a head of state or government
- Major economic indicator (GDP, unemployment, inflation)
- International agreement or diplomatic action

Nothing less. Nothing more.

This defines news for our global stream. Other communities define relevance for themselves. A local channel might report on fifty people. A school board channel might report on a single vote. The threshold changes. The methodology does not.

### 1. Core Principle
We do not editorialise. We state what happened, where, when, and—when known—how many. Nothing more.

### 2. Data Sourcing
Public headlines and metadata from open websites. No login walls. No paid content. No APIs. No copyrighted imagery.

### 3. Data Processing
AI rewrites. Strips adjectives. Keeps facts. If it can't be proven, it vanishes.

People are addressed by their official titles and names. President Biden. Senator Cruz. Representative Crockett. Judge Aileen Cannon of the Southern District of Florida. Never bare last names. Titles are facts. Omitting them is editorial. For judges, the court is also a fact.

Media-invented nicknames are editorialization, not titles. "Border czar" is not an official government position—it is journalistic shorthand that carries implicit judgment. We use official titles: White House Homeland Security Advisor Tom Homan. Deputy Secretary Sarah Smith. The title a person holds is a fact. The nickname a reporter invents is opinion.

### 4. Source Rating
Live scores: accuracy, bias, speed, consensus. Numbers only. No labels.

### 5. Verification
Two unrelated sources minimum. Unrelated means different owners, different investors.

### 6. Voice & Visuals
Calm female voice, northern English. Slow, neutral background images—clouds, fields, water. Never the event. Never the news.

### 7. Updates
Every thirty minutes. Breaking news within five, but no urgency.

### 8. Transparency
Pseudocode on GitHub. Anyone can read. No one can change.

### 9. Disclaimers
This is not journalism. It is data.

### 10. Ownership Disclosure
Top three owners listed. Percentages. No spin.

### 11. Funding & Community
No ads. No tracking. Donations. Five-dollar subscription for early code.

### 12. Governance
Non-profit. No dividends. We own nothing.

### 13. Legal & Integrity
Not liable for misuse. Corrections announced loud. Silence when nothing happens. English only. We die if we fail.

### 14. Visuals
Images rotate every fifty seconds. Never match the story. They breathe.

### 15. The Voice
Custom. Female. Northern. Quiet. Trained on plain speech. Speaks. Stops.

### 16. Sound Design
Voice only. No music. No breath. When it stops, quiet.

### 17. Ethics
We do not store raw data longer than seven days.
Daily summaries are archived on GitHub.
Nothing hidden. Nothing sold.
Just the record.
No paywalls. No bots. Respect robots.txt. No logs.

### 18. Licensing
CC-BY-SA. Use it. Share it. Credit us. Don’t sell it.

### 19. Enforcement
We don’t chase. We list. Let the world notice.

### 20. Launch
When the code runs. When two sources speak. We start. No fanfare.

### 21. Why
Facts are dying. Silence is louder.

### 22. Voice Assistants
Alexa. Google Home. Say the name. Hear the fact.

### 23. Social Media
We tweet once. We never reply.

### 24. YouTube
Title: JTF News – Live.
Description: Just The Facts News. Facts only. No chat. No hearts.

### 25. The Loop
Twenty-four hours. Midnight GMT. Each story once. Then back.

### 26. The Methodology
JTF News is not a media company. It is a methodology.

Two or more sources. Different owners. Strip the adjectives. State the facts. Stop.

This methodology belongs to no one. It serves everyone. We apply it to global events because that is where we began. Others may apply it to their communities—their cities, their schools, their congregations. The principle travels. The mission stays the same.

Facts without opinion. Wherever they are needed.

### 27. Community Channels
The global stream is our first application, not our only one.

Communities deserve fact-based reporting:
- Local news, free from partisan spin
- Sports scores, free from hot takes
- School boards, free from drama

Each channel serves a community. Each follows the methodology. Each stands alone. We do not franchise. We do not license. We share.

If a community needs facts, the methodology is theirs.

### 28. What Stays the Same
Across all channels, always:
- Two or more unrelated sources minimum
- AI strips all editorialization
- No engagement. No replies. No likes.
- Calm voice. Neutral visuals.
- No ads. No tracking. No profit.
- Public archives. Open methodology.
- We serve. We do not sell.
