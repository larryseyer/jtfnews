# Just the Facts News

## Algorithmic Reporting for a Narrative-Free World

*"If we stay boring enough, we might just change the world."*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Executive Summary

Just the Facts News (JTF News) is a nonprofit initiative dedicated to
structured factual reporting without commentary, analysis, or narrative
framing.

We apply a transparent, replicable methodology to identify, corroborate,
and present recent events of public significance. Our first
implementation is a continuously updated global news stream. The
methodology is designed to be portable and adaptable to local
communities.

We do not interpret events.
We do not speculate.
We do not persuade.

We record.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Definition of News (Global Stream)

A verifiable event occurring within the previous twenty-four hours that
meets at least one defined public-impact threshold, including scale,
financial magnitude, formal government action, confirmed violent crime,
macroeconomic indicators, or internationally recognized emergencies.

These thresholds define the global stream only. Local or thematic
channels may set different quantitative thresholds while applying the
same methodology.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Core Principle

JTF News provides structured factual reporting without commentary,
opinion, speculation, or interpretive framing.

Each item states: - What occurred - Where it occurred - When it
occurred - Who was formally involved - Quantifiable outcomes when
available

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Verification Standard

An event must be corroborated by at least two qualifying, unrelated
sources prior to publication. Where ownership independence cannot be
reasonably confirmed, publication is deferred.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Data Processing

Text is processed through a rule-based transformation system supported
by AI that: - Removes descriptive and evaluative language - Removes
speculation and predictions - Standardizes titles and naming
conventions - Extracts quantifiable facts - Excludes unsupported claims

The system does not add facts not present in source material.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Transparency & Governance

-   Independent nonprofit oversight
-   Public documentation of methodology
-   Version-controlled changes
-   Public corrections log
-   No advertising or sale of user data

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Licensing

Published summaries are licensed under CC-BY-SA. Attribution is
required.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Limits of the Model

JTF News does not provide opinion, analysis, forecasts, or policy
advocacy. Disagreements between sources are reported as disagreements of
record. The system mitigates bias through transparency and defined
rules, not claims of perfect neutrality.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Mission

To provide a structured factual reference layer beneath public
discourse.

When narrative is removed, the record remains.
