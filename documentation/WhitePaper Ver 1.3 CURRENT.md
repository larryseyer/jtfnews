# Just the Facts News

## Algorithmic Reporting for a Narrative-Free World

*"If we stay boring enough, we might just change the world."*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Methodology

**Two sources. Different owners. Strip the adjectives. State the facts. Stop.**

This is not journalism. It is data.

JTF News is not a media company. It is a methodology. The methodology belongs to no one. It serves everyone. What follows is our first application—a global news stream. Others may apply the same principles to their communities, their cities, their schools, their congregations. The principle travels. The mission stays the same.

Facts without opinion. Wherever they are needed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Executive Summary

Just the Facts News (JTF News) is a nonprofit initiative dedicated to structured factual reporting without commentary, analysis, or narrative framing.

We apply a transparent, replicable methodology to identify, corroborate, and present recent events of public significance. Our first implementation is a continuously updated global news stream. The methodology is designed to be portable and adaptable to local communities.

We do not interpret events.
We do not speculate.
We do not persuade.

We record.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Definition of News

A verifiable event, within the last twenty-four hours, that meets at least one of these criteria:

- Affects five hundred people or more
- Costs or invests at least one million US dollars
- Changes a law or regulation
- Redraws a border
- Involves death or violent crime
- Major scientific or technological achievement
- Humanitarian milestone
- Official statement or action by a head of state or government
- Major economic indicator (GDP, unemployment, inflation)
- International agreement or diplomatic action
- Major natural disaster, pandemic, or public health emergency

Nothing less. Nothing more.

These thresholds define the global stream. Other communities define relevance for themselves. A local channel might report on fifty people. A school board channel might report on a single vote. The threshold changes. The methodology does not.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Core Principle

We do not editorialise. We state what happened, where, when, and—when known—how many. Nothing more.

Each item states:
- What occurred
- Where it occurred
- When it occurred
- Who was formally involved
- Quantifiable outcomes when available

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Verification Standard

Two unrelated sources minimum. Unrelated means different owners, different investors. Where cross-ownership makes full independence difficult to confirm, no common majority shareholder is the minimum threshold.

Where ownership independence cannot be reasonably confirmed, publication is deferred.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Data Sourcing

Public headlines and metadata from open websites. No login walls. No paid content. No APIs. No copyrighted imagery.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Data Processing

AI rewrites. Strips adjectives. Keeps facts. If it can't be proven, it vanishes.

The system:
- Removes descriptive and evaluative language
- Removes speculation and predictions
- Standardizes titles and naming conventions
- Extracts quantifiable facts
- Excludes unsupported claims

The system does not add facts not present in source material.

### Official Titles

People are addressed by their official titles and names. President [surname]. Senator [surname]. Representative [surname]. Judge [surname] of the [district or circuit]. Never bare last names. Titles are facts. Omitting them is editorial. For judges, the court is also a fact.

Media-invented nicknames are editorialization, not titles. A journalistic shorthand like "border czar" is not an official government position—it carries implicit judgment. We use official titles only. The title a person holds is a fact. The nickname a reporter invents is opinion.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## AI Transparency & Bias Mitigation

The AI rewriting step is not neutral by default. Language models carry inherited biases from training data. We mitigate this through:

- Public pseudocode and processing logic on GitHub
- Periodic human audits of output against source material
- Community reporting of detected bias or distortion
- Logging of all editorial decisions the algorithm makes (what was stripped, what was kept)

No algorithm is perfect. Ours is visible.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Source Ownership Disclosure

For each story, the top three owners of each cited source are listed. Percentages. No spin. This lets the audience see who funds the information they are receiving.

Live source scores: accuracy, bias, speed, consensus. Numbers only. No labels.

### Ownership Data Maintenance

Ownership structures change. Acquisitions happen. Shareholders shift. We review and verify all source ownership data quarterly. Updates are logged publicly on GitHub.

Stale data is dishonest data. We do not let it drift.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Voice & Visuals

Calm female voice, northern English. Slow, neutral background images—clouds, fields, water. Never the event. Never the news.

Images rotate every fifty seconds. Never match the story. They breathe.

Voice only. No music. No breath. When it stops, quiet.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Updates

Every thirty minutes. Breaking news within five, but no urgency.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Corrections & Retractions

When a fact passes the two-source test but is later proven false:

- A correction is issued within the next update cycle
- The original item is marked as corrected in the archive, never silently deleted
- If the error is fundamental, a full retraction is issued with explanation
- Corrections are given the same prominence as the original item
- A running corrections log is maintained publicly on GitHub

We do not bury mistakes. We name them.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Transparency & Governance

- Independent nonprofit oversight
- No dividends. We own nothing.
- Public documentation of methodology
- Pseudocode on GitHub. Anyone can read. No one can change.
- Version-controlled changes
- Public corrections log
- No advertising or sale of user data

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Ethics

We do not store raw data longer than seven days.
Daily summaries are archived on GitHub.
Nothing hidden. Nothing sold.
Just the record.
No paywalls. No bots. Respect robots.txt. No logs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Funding

No ads. No tracking. Donations only.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Licensing

CC-BY-SA. This is our sharing mechanism. No commercial license required. Use it. Share it. Credit us. Build on it. The methodology is free because facts should be free.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Social Media

We post once per platform. We do not reply. No engagement. No likes. Corrections are the sole exception—corrections are posted with the same reach as the original.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## YouTube

Title: JTF News – Live.
Description: Just The Facts News. Facts only. No chat. No hearts.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Loop

Twenty-four hours. Midnight GMT. Each story once. Then back.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Community Channels

The global stream is our first application, not our only one.

Communities deserve fact-based reporting:
- Local news, free from partisan spin
- Sports scores, free from hot takes
- School boards, free from drama

Each channel serves a community. Each follows the methodology. Each stands alone.

If a community needs facts, the methodology is theirs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What Stays the Same

Across all channels, always:
- Two or more unrelated sources minimum
- AI strips all editorialization
- No engagement. No replies. No likes.
- Calm voice. Neutral visuals.
- No ads. No tracking. No profit.
- Public archives. Open methodology.
- We serve. We do not sell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Limits of the Model

JTF News does not provide opinion, analysis, forecasts, or policy advocacy. Disagreements between sources are reported as disagreements of record. The system mitigates bias through transparency and defined rules, not claims of perfect neutrality.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Mission

To provide a structured factual reference layer beneath public discourse.

When narrative is removed, the record remains.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Why

Because the world needs a place where facts stand alone.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Launch

When the code runs. When two sources speak. We start. No fanfare.
